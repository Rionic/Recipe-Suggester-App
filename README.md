# Welcome to Recipe Suggester!

This is a full-stack web application I created in my spare time. It allows the user to find a recipe based off of paramaters received such as ingredients, recipe name, and dietary restrictions! The user is able to make an account and saved recipes that he/she likes to their account! 

*WARNING*

The API being used for this application has a small request limit of 150/day on the free version. It is very easy to hit this limit if you decide to spam requests, so please keep this in mind.
